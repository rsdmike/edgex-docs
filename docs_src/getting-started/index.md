# Getting Started

To get started you need to obtain EdgeX Foundry either as a User or as a
Developer/Contributor.

**User**

If you simply want to obtain the EdgeX platform and run it (but do not
intend to modify or add to the existing code base at this time) then you
are considered a "User". You will want to follow the
[Getting Started Users](./Ch-GettingStartedUsers.md) guide. The
Getting Started Users guide will take you through the process of getting
the latest release EdgeX Docker Containers from Docker Hub. If you wish
to get the latest EdgeX containers (those built from the current ongoing
development efforts prior to release), then see
[Getting Started Users - Nexus](./Ch-GettingStartedUsersNexus.md). 

!!! WARNING
    Containers used from Nexus are considered "work in progress". There is no guarantee
    that these containers will function properly or function properly with
    other containers from the current release.

**Contributor/Developer**

If you want to modify, add to or at least build the existing EdgeX code
base, then you are considered a "Developer". "Contributors" are
developers that further wish to contribute their code back into the
EdgeX open source effort. You will want to follow the
[Getting Started for Developers](./Ch-GettingStartedDevelopers.md) guide.

**Hybrid**

See [Getting Started Hybrid](./Ch-GettingStartedHybrid.md) if you
are developing or working on a particular micro service, but want to run
the other micro services via Docker Containers. When working on
something like an analytics service (as a developer or contributor) you
may not wish to download, build and run all the EdgeX code - you only
want to work with the code of your service. Your new service may still
need to communicate with other services while you test your new service.
Unless you want to get and build all the services, developers will often
get and run the containers for the other EdgeX micro services and run
only their service natively in a development environment. The EdgeX
community refers to this as Hybrid development.

**Device Service Developer**

As a developer, if you intend to connect IoT objects (device, sensor or
other "thing") that are not currently connected to EdgeX Foundry, you
may also want to obtain the Device Service Software Development Kit (DS
SDK) and create new device services. The DS SDK creates all the
scaffolding code for a new EdgeX Foundry device service; allowing you to
focus on the details of interfacing with the device in its native
protocol. See [Getting Started with Device SDK](./Ch-GettingStartedSDK.md)
for help on using the DS SDK to create a new device service. Learn more
about Device Services and the Device Service SDK at
[Device Services](../microservices/device/Ch-DeviceServices.md).

**Application Service Developer**

As a developer, if you intend to get EdgeX sensor data to external
systems (be that an enterprise application, on-prem server or Cloud
platform like Azure IoT Hub, AWS IoT, Google Cloud IOT, etc.), you will
likely want to obtain the Application Functions SDK (App Func SDK) and
create new application services. The App Func SDK creates all the
scaffolding code for a new EdgeX Foundry application service; allowing
you to focus on the details of data transformation, filtering, and
otherwise prepare the sensor data for the external endpoint. Learn more
about Application Services and the Application Functions SDK at
[Application Services](../microservices/application/ApplicationServices.md).
